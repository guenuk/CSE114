    public static String doc = "For most of you, this will be your first class in computer science. Here is some advice on how to approach this class.Skim the relevant chapters in the suggested reading before you come to lecture, and read more carefully after the lecture.  The lecture will not assume that you have read the suggested chapter in advance, and the lecture should help you understand the context and key points of the chapter.  Nevertheless, the lecture does not fully replace reading, because the lecture may omit fine points that are discussed in the reading assignment. Concentrate in lecture.  The concepts that are presented in lecture are what is important; you will be able to find the details in the book or in my lecture notes.  If you want to write down everything that is said and then try to figure it out later, you are wasting your time coming to lecture.  Instead, think about what is being said.  I will ask many questions.  Try to answer all of them even if you do only in your head.  Raise your hand and ask a question when you do not understand something.  Try to understand everything.  Do not give up!  You are welcome to ask as many questions as you wish, but try not to answer too many of my questions.  This is to give others a chance to answer them too. Participate in the labs.  You will be sitting at a computer in a room with a teaching assistant and a few other students.  Take advantage of the computer by trying things out.  That way, you will discover the things that you do not understand in a setting where there are plenty of others to help you out.  Try to read the lab assignment before you come.  Respect the assignments.  Some students expect that the assignments will be straightforward if they have done the reading and concentrated in lecture.  Not so! The assignments are designed to challenge you by requiring that you apply the concepts you have learned to new situations.  The assignments will be your most important learning experience in the course.  They will rarely be straightforward.  First couple assignments may seem straightforward but that is not a good indication of what the remaining assignments will be like.  Assignments become more complex as we incorporate more concepts and ideas into them throughout the semester. Here is a suggestion on how you might approach each assignment: In the long history of the world, only a few generations have been granted the role of defending freedom in its hour of maximum danger.";
